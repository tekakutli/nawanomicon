- dimensionality reduction algorithms
  - t-SNE and UMAP had long been the favorites
  - "Deep TDA" combines self-supervised learning and Topological Data Analysis (TDA)
    - unlock new insights from complex datasets
    - more robust to noise and outliers in the data
- [[https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1678970340033150977][Self-Supervised]] Learning with Lie Symmetries for Partial Differential Equations
  - computationally efficient alternatives to numerical solvers
  - self-supervised learn general-purpose representations of PDEs from heterogeneous data
* GPT
** CLASSIFIER
- gzip instead of parameters for classification
